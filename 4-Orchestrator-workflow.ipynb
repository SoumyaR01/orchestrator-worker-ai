    "### Orchestrator-Worker\n",
    "In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you canâ€™t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas itâ€™s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibilityâ€”subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input."

    "### Creating Workers Dynamically In Langgraph \n",
    "Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node.

The section should define Agentic AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), explain their integration, and their relevance in modern AI.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I need to define Agentic AI. From what I know, Agentic AI refers to autonomous AI systems that can act on behalf of users, making decisions and performing tasks. They should have capabilities like goal-setting, reasoning, and learning. Maybe mention autonomy, adaptability, and task execution.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next, RAG systems. RAG combines retrieval from a database with generative models. So, when a query comes in, the system retrieves relevant information from a corpus and then generates a response using that data. This helps in providing accurate and up-to-date information without relying solely on the model's training data.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, integrating Agentic AI with RAG. How do they work together? The agent can use RAG to fetch information needed to perform tasks. For example, an agent handling customer service might retrieve past interactions or product details using RAG to generate a personalized response. This integration enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks with real-time data.\n",
       "\n",
       "Relevance in modern applications: Businesses need efficient and accurate AI systems. Agentic AI with RAG can improve customer support by accessing real-time data, enhance research by retrieving and summarizing academic papers, or optimize logistics by analyzing current data. Mention industries like healthcare, finance, and tech where this integration is beneficial.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should structure the section starting with definitions, then explain the integration, and finally discuss their applications and benefits. Use clear examples to illustrate points. Avoid technical jargon where possible to keep it accessible. Make sure each part connects logically, showing how combining these two technologies addresses current AI challenges like data freshness and task complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Check if there are any potential misunderstandings. For instance, clarify that RAG isn't just retrieval but also involves generation, and Agentic AI isn't just automation but includes decision-making. Emphasize that together they offer a more dynamic and informed AI system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, consider the audience. The report might be for professionals or students, so the explanation should be thorough but not overly simplistic. Mention specific technologies or companies that use these systems as examples, if applicable. However, the user hasn't provided specific instances, so maybe keep it general.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, conclude the section by summarizing the key points and reinforcing the importance of this integration in advancing AI capabilities. Make sure the markdown formatting is correct, with headers and bold terms as needed.\n",

       "# Introduction to Agentic AI RAGs\n",
       "\n",
       "**Agentic AI** refers to autonomous AI systems capable of initiating actions, making decisions, and adapting to dynamic environments. These systems operate with goal-directed behavior, leveraging planning, reasoning, and learning mechanisms to perform tasks independently. Agentic AI is distinguished by its ability to interact with external systems, process real-time data, and execute complex workflows, making it a cornerstone of modern AI applications like chatbots, robotic assistants, and automated customer service agents.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid AI architecture that combines information retrieval and natural language generation. RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents or data from a curated knowledge source in response to a query, then synthesize this information into a coherent, context-aware response using a generative model. This approach enhances the accuracy and relevance of AI outputs by grounding responses in external, up-to-date data rather than relying solely on static training data.\n",
       "\n",
       "The integration of **Agentic AI with RAG systems** creates a powerful framework for addressing complex, real-world challenges. Agentic AI leverages RAGâ€™s retrieval capabilities to access domain-specific knowledge, while RAG benefits from the agentâ€™s ability to plan, prioritize, and execute multi-step tasks. For example, an agentic RAG system could autonomously research a userâ€™s query by retrieving scholarly articles, analyze the results to identify key insights, and generate a tailored summary. This synergy enables AI to deliver more accurate, context-sensitive, and actionable outputs across applications such as personalized education, enterprise decision-making, and scientific research. \n",
       "\n",
       "In modern AI, this integration addresses critical limitations like data staleness and task complexity, offering scalable solutions that adapt to evolving user needs and knowledge landscapes.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "<think>\n",
       "Okay, the user wants me to write a report section called \"Technical Overview\" with the description explaining the architecture, key components, and workflow of Agentic AI RAG systems. Let me start by breaking down what each part entails.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, the architecture. RAG systems typically involve retrieval and generation. Agentic AI adds an agent layer, so I need to mention components like the retrieval module, generative model, and the agent's role in coordinating them. Maybe mention how the agent interacts with these components, perhaps using a loop for iterative processing.\n",
       "\n",
